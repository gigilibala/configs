# Development Configs

These are some of my editor config files. Feel free to use them.

## Initial Setup

Just run:

```bash
$HOME/configs/setup.sh
```

## Emacs

The first time starting emacs, it will fail as you need to install
[`use-package`](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package) package first (probably
through `package-list-packages`). Then try to load emacs again.
